question: Eligibility requirements not met
subquestion: |

  **Unfortunately, you are *not* eligible for the NDIS.**
 
 
  
  To access the NDIS, you must be between 7 and 65 years old. 
  
  **You must also live in Australia and be either an 
  Australian citizen or holder of a protected or special category Visa.**
  
  
  *Based on what you told us, you do not meet one of these residency requirements, therefore
  you are unable to access the NDIS.*
  
  
  The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) makes the final decision
  about who gets to receive support under the NDIS. If you would still like to 
  check if you are eligible you should contact them to discuss your eligibility. 
 
  
  Thank you for using the NDIS Advisor.
