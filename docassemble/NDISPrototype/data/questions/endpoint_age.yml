  To access the NDIS, you must be between 7 and 65 years old.
  
  You have indicated that you are **${ user_age }** years old. 
  
  According to **section 22** of the [*National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013* (Cth)](https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2013A00020)
  your answers indicate that you do not meet this requirement.
  
  **This means you may not be eligible to access the NDIS.**
  
  The National Disability Insurance Agency (NDIA) makes the final decision
  about who gets to receive support under the NDIS. If you would still like to 
  check if you are eligible you should contact them to discuss your eligibility.
